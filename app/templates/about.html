                        Osler Elementary School, where you'll usually find me chatting with friends, splashing around in
                        the pool with my swim buddies, or totally lost in a book at home. I've also been getting into
                        breakdancing, so you might even spot me striking a pose around school! My friends and I have had
                        a blast creating World Helper, and we can't wait for you to join in the fun too!</p>

                        in Grade 4 at Sir William Osler Elementary, where I've been for five years now. When I'm not
                        drawing, painting, or making cool crafts, you'll probably find me swimming, flipping around in
                        gymnastics, or dancing to my favorite tunes. I speak Cantonese and have a big love for ramen,
                        hotpot, k-pop, and, of course, anything artsy! Worldhelper has been an amazing project, and I
                        can't wait for you to check it out!</p>

                        School. I love coding and editing, and in my free time, you can find me doing art, swimming, or
                        cooking up something fun! Even when I was 8 and in 3rd grade, I was already diving into the
                        world of tech and learning a ton about coding. I'm always excited to keep learning and creating
                        cool things!
